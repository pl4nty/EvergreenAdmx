# EvergreenAdmx

After deploying several Azure Virtual Desktop environments I decided I no longer wanted to manually download the Admx files I needed, and I wanted a way to keep them up-to-date.

This script solves both problems.
*  Checks for newer versions of the Admx files that are present and processes the new version if found
*  Optionally copies the new Admx files to the Policy Store or Definition folder, or a folder of your choosing

The name I chose for this script is an ode to the [Evergreen module](https://github.com/aaronparker/Evergreen) by Aaron Parker [@stealthpuppy](https://twitter.com/stealthpuppy).

## How to use

Quick start:
*  Download the script to a location of your choosing (for example: C:\Scripts\EvergreenAdmx)
*  Run or schedule the script

You can also install the script from the PowerShell Gallery [EvergreenAdmx][poshgallery-evergreenadmx] :
```powershell
Install-Script -Name EvergreenAdmx
```

I have scheduled the script to run daily:

```powershell
EvergreenAdmx.ps1 -PolicyStore "C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions"
```

The above execution will keep the central Policy Store up-to-date on a daily basis.

A sample .xml file that you can import in Task Scheduler is provided with this script.

`Breaking change starting from 2402.1`

The -WindowsVersion parameter was added back and is now an alias of -Windows11Version

Valid entries are "Custom Policy Store", "Windows 10", "Windows 11", "Microsoft Edge", "Microsoft OneDrive", "Microsoft Office", "FSLogix", "Adobe Acrobat", "Adobe Reader", "BIS-F", "Citrix Workspace App", "Google Chrome", "Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack", "Mozilla Firefox", "Zoom Desktop Client", "Azure Virtual Desktop".

`Breaking change starting from 2301.1`

Valid entries are "Custom Policy Store", "Windows 10", "Windows 11", "Microsoft Edge", "Microsoft OneDrive", "Microsoft Office", "FSLogix", "Adobe Acrobat", "Adobe Reader", "BIS-F", "Citrix Workspace App", "Google Chrome", "Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack", "Mozilla Firefox", "Zoom Desktop Client".

`Breaking change starting from 2112.1`

Windows 11 was added to the script, and that means the -WindowsVersion parameter was substituted with -Windows10Version and -Windows11Version.
These MUST be used and for the same Windows version as any 'Include' options you provide.

From this version the 'Includes' will default to "Windows 11", "Microsoft Edge", "Microsoft OneDrive", "Microsoft Office".

`Breaking change starting from 2101.2`

This script no longer processes all the products by default. There's no need to comment out any products you don't need anymore.

In 2101.2 the parameter 'Include' was introduced which is an array you can use to specify all products that need to be processed. This parameter is required for the script to be able to run.
Valid entries are "Custom Policy Store", "Windows 10" or "Windows 11", "Microsoft Edge", "Microsoft OneDrive", "Microsoft Office", "FSLogix", "Adobe Acrobat", "Adobe Reader", "BIS-F", "Citrix Workspace App", "Google Chrome", "Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack", "Mozilla Firefox", "Zoom Desktop Client".

By default, if you don't use this parameter, only "Windows 11", "Microsoft Edge", "Microsoft OneDrive", "Microsoft Office" is processed.

## Notes

I have not tested this script on Windows Core.
Some of the Admx files can only be obtained by installing the package that was downloaded.
For instance, the Windows 10 and Windows 11 Admx files are in an msi file, the OneDrive and VS Code Admx files are in the installation folder after installing the application.
If you are going to use the script to download Windows 10 or Windows 11 Admx files, you will need to remove any installs of the Windows 10 or Windows 11 Admx msi, or the script will fail.
So this is what the script does for these packages: installing the package, copying the Admx files, uninstalling the package.
